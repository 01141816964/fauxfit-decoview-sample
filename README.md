# Faux Fit: Animated Google Fit style chart using DecoView

Googleâ€™s health tracking platform, Google Fit, provides data visualization using a circular view to display feedback to users. This circular view is smoothly animated and presents a variety of data about the users fitness goals.

This project aims to reproduce the Google Fit user experience in an app by using DecoView, as shown in the clip below:
